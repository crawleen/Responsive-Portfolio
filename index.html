			<h1>About Me</h1>
			<img id="me" alt="pic of me" src="./assets/images/me.jpg"/>
			<p>Hello! My name is Colleen Miller.  I grew up in Parker,Colorado. After college I moved to San Francisco for a few years to accomplish a dream and realized I am a straight up Colorado girl and the mountains are a source of passion for me. I'm an outgoing, genuine girl who loves to have a good time! I'm just as goofy as I am grounded. I can adapt to any environment no matter how fancy, how professional, how casual or how random it may be. I love making new connections with people everywhere I go and have friends from all walks of life and consider that one of my greatest assets.</p>
			<p>It’s all about adventure and fun.I love traveling to new places and pushing myself above perceived limits.Good food, wine,and company are life’s musts.I like to mix it up:one night hang at the local dive bar;the next go swanky!I love trying new restaurants but two of my local favorites:Cafe Brazil and Bistro Vendome.I am enamored with French culture and love to tell stories of my adventures in S. America.</p>
			<p>Just a few of my favorite things...skiing, camping, Chianti, snowshoeing, Autumn days in Colorado, staying in watching football on a cloudy day, charity work, and deep conversation with a good friend.</p>
